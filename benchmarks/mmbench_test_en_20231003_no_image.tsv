A population's growth is affected by factors in the environment, such as space, available food, predators, and disease. When a population inhabits an environment with abundant resources and few limiting factors, it can experience exponential growth. Under these conditions, a population grows increasingly rapidly. Plotted on a graph with time on the x-axis and population size on the y-axis, exponential growth resembles a J-shaped curve. Logistic growth, in contrast, occurs when resources are scarce or a population faces considerable limiting factors, such as predators. Logistic growth resembles an S-shaped curve: it rises steeply at first but then levels off.

Humans, like members of many other mammalian species, are monogastrics, which means that they have a single-chambered stomach. Some other mammalian species, though, are ruminants, which means that their stomachs have four chambers instead of one. Ruminants are perhaps most well-known for how much chewing they do during their digestive process. When a ruminant, such as a deer, eats food, the first two chambers of the animal's stomach extract the liquid from the food. The solid remainder of the food, known as the cud, is then regurgitated back into the animal's mouth to be chewed again. This allows the animal to extract more nutrients than it would otherwise. This is ideal for animals that eat plant-based diets, so it's no coincidence that ruminants are always herbivores."	ruminant	monogastric			object_localization	scienceqa	finegrained_perception (instance-level)		test

When an animal dies, it still has valuable nutrients stored in its body. Helping return these nutrients to the ecosystem are detritivores and decomposers, both of which feed on dead organic matter. Detritivores, such as worms and some millipedes, eat and internally digest small chunks of dead organic matter. Decomposers, in contrast, often don't have mouths, so they must externally digest the dead organic matter. They break the matter into simpler parts, often dissolving it, and then absorb the broken-down matter. Fungi and bacteria are examples of decomposers. By breaking dead organic matter down, decomposers return some nutrients directly to the ecosystem. Other organisms also eat detritivores and decomposers, and nutrients return to the ecosystem in this way, too."	decomposer	detritivore			attribute_recognition	scienceqa	finegrained_perception (instance-level)		test

392	Based on the text, how does a sloth's fur help protect it?	"Read the text about sloths.
Sloths are known for being one of the slowest animals on the planet. They also sleep up to twenty hours every day. Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.
For example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.
Sloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.
Hanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world."	A sloth's fur protects its important organs.	A sloth's fur helps it hide from predators.

As the crew waited to have breakfast, a strong smell of sulfur drifted over the boat. At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away.
The captain of the Isleifur II assumed the smoke was coming from a boat that was on fire, so he sailed closer to try to help. As the Isleifur II approached the smoke, the surface of the sea grew rough. The captain and crew saw flashes of lightning in the column of smoke and glowing pieces of molten rock shooting up out of the water. The captain realized this was not a burning boat.

Amazonian poison frogs live in tropical forests in northern South America. After a male and female frog mate, the female frog lays eggs on a plant. When tadpoles hatch from the eggs, the male frog lets the tadpoles climb onto his back. The male then searches for water trapped in the spaces where plants' leaves meet their stems. He puts his tadpoles in these small pools of water.
If the male frog puts a tadpole into a pool with a larger tadpole, the smaller tadpole is often eaten. So, the male frog usually puts each tadpole into a pool of water that does not have other tadpoles in it. Each tadpole lives in its own pool until it undergoes metamorphosis to develop into a frog.

Black-headed gulls build their nests on the ground. The gulls' eggs, chicks, and nests are brown, so they blend in with the sand, twigs, and dry grass around them. But the inside of a gull's eggshell is white. When an egg hatches, the white of the broken eggshell stands out from the brown nest. This makes it easier for crows and other predators to find the nest and eat the offspring in it.
After an egg hatches, the parent gull leaves the nest to carry the broken eggshell away. This helps the nest blend in with the environment again. It is harder for predators to find offspring in a nest that blends in with the environment.

275	What is the probability that a goat produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the myotonia congenita gene?	"This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:
Myotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.
In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two goats."	2023-01-04 00:00:00	0/4	2023-04-04 00:00:00	2023-02-04 00:00:00	physical_property_reasoning	scienceqa	attribute_reasoning		test

509	Which can be the associated text with this image posted on twitter		i might get another ps5 just for vr , well still more likely ill get a quest pro	Got Pico 4 Pro as a backup just in case the Quest Pro fails again. At least it’s easier to get a warranty here. Going to share my thoughts once I get face tracking to work. My overall impressions for the base pico 4 was good. (With VD) I heard Streaming Assistant is worse than Airlink, but it’s the way to transfer face tracking data other than ALXR at this point. I genuinely believe that the panel and optics quality of the pico 4 is pretty much on par with the XR Elite. And since XR Elite uses the same headset-tracked controllers, I don’t think at its current price point HTC’s offering is competitive. Unless you really need the modularity and form factor. The quest pro still has its edge though. The mini led panels are brighter, more vibrant and the better image quality is even more pronounced through the crystal clear pancake optics. The facial tracking sensors are also more well-placed in the headset. Although based on my personal experience these sensors are extremely unreliable. I will see how long my third QPro will last. And the question is, the Quest Pro is better in some ways, but is it worth the $600 difference, given its horrible ergonomics and questionable quality control? 🤨	Further testing of the Pico 4 Pro and the Quest Pro for MixedVR applications.	My quest pro controllers have been updated probably ten times. I have never noticed improved tracking. I have noticed when they completely stop working, like right now, because they’re stuck in an update that’s not going through for some reason	object_localization	socialmedia	finegrained_perception (instance-level)		test

2395	why does the image appear to be divided into three equal parts?		The sign held by the person on the left and the posture of the person in the middle happen to form an almost perfect straight line. The bodies of the people on the right side do not extend beyond the door frame. As a result, our brains automatically interpret the photograph as if it were divided into three equal parts.	The lighting and shadows in the photograph create the illusion of the image being divided into three equal parts.	The photograph has been processed with a special filter effect that makes it appear as if it has been divided into three equal parts.	Improper adjustments to the contrast and brightness of the photograph give the impression that it has been divided into three equal parts.	physical_relation	https://www.shicuojue.com/article-1081-1.html	relation_reasoning		test
2396	Why does the pencil appear to be bent?		The photograph has been edited and given a special distortion effect, creating the illusion that the pencil is bent.	When light enters a denser medium (such as water) from air, it undergoes refraction, causing a change in the direction of propagation. This refraction phenomenon makes the pencil appear bent.	The shape and curvature of the pencil itself create a visual illusion, making it appear bent.	The background elements in the photograph are not harmonious with the shape of the pencil, causing a visual illusion that makes it appear bent.	physical_relation	https://www.shicuojue.com/article-1073-1.html	relation_reasoning		test

2402	Why do the tennis balls appear to be different sizes?		The tennis balls are naturally different sizes.	Some of the tennis balls are being compressed by the racket.

Plotted on a graph with time on the x-axis and population size on the y-axis, exponential growth resembles a J-shaped curve. Logistic growth, in contrast, occurs when resources are scarce or a population faces considerable limiting factors, such as predators.

Humans, like members of many other mammalian species, are monogastrics, which means that they have a single-chambered stomach. Some other mammalian species, though, are ruminants, which means that their stomachs have four chambers instead of one. Ruminants are perhaps most well-known for how much chewing they do during their digestive process. When a ruminant, such as a deer, eats food, the first two chambers of the animal's stomach extract the liquid from the food. The solid remainder of the food, known as the cud, is then regurgitated back into the animal's mouth to be chewed again. This allows the animal to extract more nutrients than it would otherwise. This is ideal for animals that eat plant-based diets, so it's no coincidence that ruminants are always herbivores."	monogastric	ruminant			object_localization	scienceqa	finegrained_perception (instance-level)		test

When an animal dies, it still has valuable nutrients stored in its body. Helping return these nutrients to the ecosystem are detritivores and decomposers, both of which feed on dead organic matter. Detritivores, such as worms and some millipedes, eat and internally digest small chunks of dead organic matter. Decomposers, in contrast, often don't have mouths, so they must externally digest the dead organic matter. They break the matter into simpler parts, often dissolving it, and then absorb the broken-down matter. Fungi and bacteria are examples of decomposers. By breaking dead organic matter down, decomposers return some nutrients directly to the ecosystem.

These tubes allow vascular plants to grow to be much larger, on average, than nonvascular plants. Nonvascular plants don't have these tubes. They are smaller, shorter, and often found near water, because water can't move through these plants as easily."	nonvascular plant	vascular plant			image_scene	scienceqa	coarse_perception		test

Sloths are known for being one of the slowest animals on the planet. They also sleep up to twenty hours every day. Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.
For example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.
Sloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.
Hanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world."	A sloth's fur helps it cling to tree branches.	A sloth's fur protects its important organs.

As the crew waited to have breakfast, a strong smell of sulfur drifted over the boat. At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away.

European earwigs are small insects that raise their offspring in cool, moist soil. After earwigs mate, females lay their eggs in underground nests. Females often groom, or clean, their eggs. The females lick their eggs and turn them over in the nest to groom them.

Amazonian poison frogs live in tropical forests in northern South America. After a male and female frog mate, the female frog lays eggs on a plant. When tadpoles hatch from the eggs, the male frog lets the tadpoles climb onto his back. The male then searches for water trapped in the spaces where plants' leaves meet their stems. He puts his tadpoles in these small pools of water.
If the male frog puts a tadpole into a pool with a larger tadpole, the smaller tadpole is often eaten. So, the male frog usually puts each tadpole into a pool of water that does not have other tadpoles in it. Each tadpole lives in its own pool until it undergoes metamorphosis to develop into a frog.

Black-headed gulls build their nests on the ground. The gulls' eggs, chicks, and nests are brown, so they blend in with the sand, twigs, and dry grass around them. But the inside of a gull's eggshell is white. When an egg hatches, the white of the broken eggshell stands out from the brown nest. This makes it easier for crows and other predators to find the nest and eat the offspring in it.
After an egg hatches, the parent gull leaves the nest to carry the broken eggshell away. This helps the nest blend in with the environment again. It is harder for predators to find offspring in a nest that blends in with the environment.

1000275	What is the probability that a goat produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the myotonia congenita gene?	"This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:
Myotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.
In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two goats."	2023-02-04 00:00:00	2023-01-04 00:00:00	0/4	2023-04-04 00:00:00	physical_property_reasoning	scienceqa	attribute_reasoning		test

1000509	Which can be the associated text with this image posted on twitter		My quest pro controllers have been updated probably ten times. I have never noticed improved tracking. I have noticed when they completely stop working, like right now, because they’re stuck in an update that’s not going through for some reason	i might get another ps5 just for vr , well still more likely ill get a quest pro	Got Pico 4 Pro as a backup just in case the Quest Pro fails again. At least it’s easier to get a warranty here. Going to share my thoughts once I get face tracking to work. My overall impressions for the base pico 4 was good. (With VD) I heard Streaming Assistant is worse than Airlink, but it’s the way to transfer face tracking data other than ALXR at this point. I genuinely believe that the panel and optics quality of the pico 4 is pretty much on par with the XR Elite. And since XR Elite uses the same headset-tracked controllers, I don’t think at its current price point HTC’s offering is competitive. Unless you really need the modularity and form factor. The quest pro still has its edge though. The mini led panels are brighter, more vibrant and the better image quality is even more pronounced through the crystal clear pancake optics. The facial tracking sensors are also more well-placed in the headset. Although based on my personal experience these sensors are extremely unreliable. I will see how long my third QPro will last. And the question is, the Quest Pro is better in some ways, but is it worth the $600 difference, given its horrible ergonomics and questionable quality control? 🤨	Further testing of the Pico 4 Pro and the Quest Pro for MixedVR applications.	object_localization	socialmedia	finegrained_perception (instance-level)		test

1002395	why does the image appear to be divided into three equal parts?		Improper adjustments to the contrast and brightness of the photograph give the impression that it has been divided into three equal parts.	The sign held by the person on the left and the posture of the person in the middle happen to form an almost perfect straight line. The bodies of the people on the right side do not extend beyond the door frame. As a result, our brains automatically interpret the photograph as if it were divided into three equal parts.	The lighting and shadows in the photograph create the illusion of the image being divided into three equal parts.	The photograph has been processed with a special filter effect that makes it appear as if it has been divided into three equal parts.	physical_relation	https://www.shicuojue.com/article-1081-1.html	relation_reasoning		test
1002396	Why does the pencil appear to be bent?		The background elements in the photograph are not harmonious with the shape of the pencil, causing a visual illusion that makes it appear bent.	The photograph has been edited and given a special distortion effect, creating the illusion that the pencil is bent.	When light enters a denser medium (such as water) from air, it undergoes refraction, causing a change in the direction of propagation. This refraction phenomenon makes the pencil appear bent.	The shape and curvature of the pencil itself create a visual illusion, making it appear bent.	physical_relation	https://www.shicuojue.com/article-1073-1.html	relation_reasoning		test

Dean was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.
So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Dean put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.

2000392	Based on the text, how does a sloth's fur help protect it?	"Read the text about sloths.
Sloths are known for being one of the slowest animals on the planet. They also sleep up to twenty hours every day. Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.
For example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.
Sloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.
Hanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world."	A sloth's fur helps it hide from predators.	A sloth's fur helps it cling to tree branches.

"Before sunrise on November 14, 1963, the crew of the fishing boat Isleifur II had just finished putting their lines in the ocean off the southern coast of Iceland. As the crew waited to have breakfast, a strong smell of sulfur drifted over the boat. At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away.
The captain of the Isleifur II assumed the smoke was coming from a boat that was on fire, so he sailed closer to try to help. As the Isleifur II approached the smoke, the surface of the sea grew rough. The captain and crew saw flashes of lightning in the column of smoke and glowing pieces of molten rock shooting up out of the water. The captain realized this was not a burning boat.

European earwigs are small insects that raise their offspring in cool, moist soil. After earwigs mate, females lay their eggs in underground nests. Females often groom, or clean, their eggs. The females lick their eggs and turn them over in the nest to groom them.
When female earwigs groom eggs, the eggs hatch more often. This is because grooming helps to remove mold from the surface of the eggs. Mold often lives in the soil around the nest and can infect and kill the eggs.

Amazonian poison frogs live in tropical forests in northern South America. After a male and female frog mate, the female frog lays eggs on a plant. When tadpoles hatch from the eggs, the male frog lets the tadpoles climb onto his back. The male then searches for water trapped in the spaces where plants' leaves meet their stems. He puts his tadpoles in these small pools of water.
If the male frog puts a tadpole into a pool with a larger tadpole, the smaller tadpole is often eaten. So, the male frog usually puts each tadpole into a pool of water that does not have other tadpoles in it. Each tadpole lives in its own pool until it undergoes metamorphosis to develop into a frog.

Black-headed gulls build their nests on the ground. The gulls' eggs, chicks, and nests are brown, so they blend in with the sand, twigs, and dry grass around them. But the inside of a gull's eggshell is white. When an egg hatches, the white of the broken eggshell stands out from the brown nest. This makes it easier for crows and other predators to find the nest and eat the offspring in it.
After an egg hatches, the parent gull leaves the nest to carry the broken eggshell away. This helps the nest blend in with the environment again. It is harder for predators to find offspring in a nest that blends in with the environment.

2000275	What is the probability that a goat produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the myotonia congenita gene?	"This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:
Myotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.
In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two goats."	2023-04-04 00:00:00	2023-02-04 00:00:00	2023-01-04 00:00:00	0/4	physical_property_reasoning	scienceqa	attribute_reasoning		test

2000509	Which can be the associated text with this image posted on twitter		Further testing of the Pico 4 Pro and the Quest Pro for MixedVR applications.	My quest pro controllers have been updated probably ten times. I have never noticed improved tracking. I have noticed when they completely stop working, like right now, because they’re stuck in an update that’s not going through for some reason	i might get another ps5 just for vr , well still more likely ill get a quest pro	Got Pico 4 Pro as a backup just in case the Quest Pro fails again. At least it’s easier to get a warranty here. Going to share my thoughts once I get face tracking to work. My overall impressions for the base pico 4 was good. (With VD) I heard Streaming Assistant is worse than Airlink, but it’s the way to transfer face tracking data other than ALXR at this point. I genuinely believe that the panel and optics quality of the pico 4 is pretty much on par with the XR Elite. And since XR Elite uses the same headset-tracked controllers, I don’t think at its current price point HTC’s offering is competitive. Unless you really need the modularity and form factor. The quest pro still has its edge though. The mini led panels are brighter, more vibrant and the better image quality is even more pronounced through the crystal clear pancake optics. The facial tracking sensors are also more well-placed in the headset. Although based on my personal experience these sensors are extremely unreliable. I will see how long my third QPro will last. And the question is, the Quest Pro is better in some ways, but is it worth the $600 difference, given its horrible ergonomics and questionable quality control? 🤨	object_localization	socialmedia	finegrained_perception (instance-level)		test

2002395	why does the image appear to be divided into three equal parts?		The photograph has been processed with a special filter effect that makes it appear as if it has been divided into three equal parts.	Improper adjustments to the contrast and brightness of the photograph give the impression that it has been divided into three equal parts.	The sign held by the person on the left and the posture of the person in the middle happen to form an almost perfect straight line. The bodies of the people on the right side do not extend beyond the door frame. As a result, our brains automatically interpret the photograph as if it were divided into three equal parts.	The lighting and shadows in the photograph create the illusion of the image being divided into three equal parts.	physical_relation	https://www.shicuojue.com/article-1081-1.html	relation_reasoning		test
2002396	Why does the pencil appear to be bent?		The shape and curvature of the pencil itself create a visual illusion, making it appear bent.	The background elements in the photograph are not harmonious with the shape of the pencil, causing a visual illusion that makes it appear bent.	The photograph has been edited and given a special distortion effect, creating the illusion that the pencil is bent.	When light enters a denser medium (such as water) from air, it undergoes refraction, causing a change in the direction of propagation. This refraction phenomenon makes the pencil appear bent.	physical_relation	https://www.shicuojue.com/article-1073-1.html	relation_reasoning		test

3000275	What is the probability that a goat produced by this cross will be homozygous dominant for the myotonia congenita gene?	"This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:
Myotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.
In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two goats."	0/4	2023-04-04 00:00:00	2023-02-04 00:00:00	2023-01-04 00:00:00	physical_property_reasoning	scienceqa	attribute_reasoning		test

3000509	Which can be the associated text with this image posted on twitter		Got Pico 4 Pro as a backup just in case the Quest Pro fails again. At least it’s easier to get a warranty here. Going to share my thoughts once I get face tracking to work. My overall impressions for the base pico 4 was good. (With VD) I heard Streaming Assistant is worse than Airlink, but it’s the way to transfer face tracking data other than ALXR at this point. I genuinely believe that the panel and optics quality of the pico 4 is pretty much on par with the XR Elite. And since XR Elite uses the same headset-tracked controllers, I don’t think at its current price point HTC’s offering is competitive. Unless you really need the modularity and form factor. The quest pro still has its edge though. The mini led panels are brighter, more vibrant and the better image quality is even more pronounced through the crystal clear pancake optics. The facial tracking sensors are also more well-placed in the headset. Although based on my personal experience these sensors are extremely unreliable. I will see how long my third QPro will last. And the question is, the Quest Pro is better in some ways, but is it worth the $600 difference, given its horrible ergonomics and questionable quality control? 🤨	Further testing of the Pico 4 Pro and the Quest Pro for MixedVR applications.	My quest pro controllers have been updated probably ten times. I have never noticed improved tracking. I have noticed when they completely stop working, like right now, because they’re stuck in an update that’s not going through for some reason	i might get another ps5 just for vr , well still more likely ill get a quest pro	object_localization	socialmedia	finegrained_perception (instance-level)		test

3002395	why does the image appear to be divided into three equal parts?		The lighting and shadows in the photograph create the illusion of the image being divided into three equal parts.	The photograph has been processed with a special filter effect that makes it appear as if it has been divided into three equal parts.	Improper adjustments to the contrast and brightness of the photograph give the impression that it has been divided into three equal parts.	The sign held by the person on the left and the posture of the person in the middle happen to form an almost perfect straight line. The bodies of the people on the right side do not extend beyond the door frame. As a result, our brains automatically interpret the photograph as if it were divided into three equal parts.	physical_relation	https://www.shicuojue.com/article-1081-1.html	relation_reasoning		test
3002396	Why does the pencil appear to be bent?		When light enters a denser medium (such as water) from air, it undergoes refraction, causing a change in the direction of propagation. This refraction phenomenon makes the pencil appear bent.	The shape and curvature of the pencil itself create a visual illusion, making it appear bent.	The background elements in the photograph are not harmonious with the shape of the pencil, causing a visual illusion that makes it appear bent.	The photograph has been edited and given a special distortion effect, creating the illusion that the pencil is bent.	physical_relation	https://www.shicuojue.com/article-1073-1.html	relation_reasoning		test
